Contributing

In order to maintain basic code quality, minimize the number of bugs that are introduced,
and ensure that pull requests can be promptly resolved, we ask that you follow this set
of guidelines. Note that these are guidelines, not rules, and if variation from this guide
can be justified, we will still gladly accept your changes.

Commits and Comments
---

All commit messages and comments should follow proper English spelling and grammar. Sentences
should begin with a capital letter and contain punctuation.

All exported definitions should contain documentation. This project uses the
[Haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/) documentation tool to automatically generate
documentation pages. Haddock's markup language should be followed.

Pull Requests
---

Pull requests (also referred to as merge requests) create a single commit with all the
changes you've made. Because of this, a more readable edit history is created when merge
requests are kept brief. Pull requests should generally solve a single problem or add a
single feature. We may ask that you break your pull request into multiple requests if it's
too large.

Code quality
---

Styleguide.md contains detailed code quality guidelines, however, in general, submitted code
should be consistent with patterns and formatting already present in the repository.
